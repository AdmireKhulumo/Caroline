# Caroline (v1.1)
 A simple python voice assistent.
 
 ## Description
 Caroline, who is currently managed by a bunch of if-statements, is a simple python voice assistant. She is not meant to compete with the giants such as Siri and Alexa, instead, she is a cool way for me to explore the Python language and learn some important programming concepts.
 
 I give her a command in English, she transcribes what I'm saying, then replied back in both English text and voice. Check the Change Log for demos of all the features as they get added.
 
 ## Features In This Version
 * *(NEW)* Recall an entire conversation
 * Playing a song from YouTube
 * Telling the time
 * Searching wikipedia
 * Google search
 * Giving compliments
 * Stopping execution via voice command
 * Telling a random joke (of course!)


## Topics Learned
The whole premise of Caroline is to be an interesting way to learn new concepts. Here are some that I have learned in this version:
* Voice recognition
* Speech to text transcription
* Text to speech conversion
* Exception handling, classes and dunder methods
* Various Python modules
* Manual implementation of a stack in Python

## Future Improvements
* Using Natural Language Processing to replace the if statements and have Caroline intuitively understand commands.
* Training the voice recognition engine to better recognise African accents
* Modularising the code and adding more features
* Listening in the background (no explicit launch)


## Change Log

### v1.1
* Added Feature: Recalling an entire conversation - this feature uses a manually implemented stack to track and then recall an entire conversation between Caroline and the user.

### v1.0
Added all the basic features.
