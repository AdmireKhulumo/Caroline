# Caroline (v1.0)
 A simple python voice assistent.
 
 ## Description
 Caroline, who is currently managed by a bunch of if-statements, is a simple python voice assistent. She is not meant to compete with the giants such as Siri and Alexa, instead, she is a cool way for me to explore the Python language and learn some important programming concepts.
 
 I give her a command in English, she transcribes what I'm saying, then replied back in both English text and voice.
 
 ## Features In This Version
 * Playing a song from YouTube
 * Telling the time
 * Searching wikipedia
 * Google search
 * Giving compliments
 * Stopping execution via voice command
 * Telling a random joke (of course!)


## Topics Learned
The whole premise of Caroline is to be an interesting way to learn new concepts. Here are some that I have learned in this version:
* Voice recognition
* Speech to text transcription
* Text to speech conversion
* Exception handling
* Various Python modules

## Future Improvements
* Using Natural Language Processing to replace the if statements and have Caroline intuitively understand commands.
* Training the voice recognition engine to better recognise African accents
* Keeping track of the conversation using a Queue
* Modularising the code and adding more features
* Listening in the background (no explicit launch)
